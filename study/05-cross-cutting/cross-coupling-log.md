# Cross-Coupling Log

This file records architectural decisions, parameter values, and positions that downstream agents depend on. When a number or position is set here, all agents listed under "Affects" must be notified and must update their artifacts if the decision changes their scope.

## Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — Parameter name
**Parameter:** what was decided
**Value:** the specific value, range, or position
**Set by:** which agent or process set it
**Affects:** list of agents whose work depends on this
**Basis:** why this value was chosen
```

## 2026-05-03 — Autonomy TRL curve

**Parameter:** Humanoid autonomy TRL trajectory (study assumption)
**Value:** TRL 6 (space-relevant environments) by ~2029 → TRL 7+ (space-relevant) by ~2035 → TRL 8 (qualified, operational environment) by ~2038-2040
**Set by:** orchestrator (resolution of stage 4 contradiction between two incompatible registry entries)
**Affects:** autonomy-trl-tasking, human-factors-teaming, conops-integrator, technology-roadmap-trl, cost-program, far-side-base-architect (deployment timeline)
**Basis:** Study assumption with explicit go/no-go gates at each milestone. Not a forecast. See §A1 in `study/05-cross-cutting/margins-and-assumptions.md` for full text. If the 2029 gate is missed, the deployment timeline slips proportionally; if the 2035 gate is missed, the teaming model defaults to higher human-in-the-loop ratios.

## 2026-05-03 — Form factor position

**Parameter:** Space humanoid primary form factor
**Value:** Full bipedal humanoid — two legs, two arms, two dexterous hands, anthropomorphic geometry, standing height 1.5–1.9 m, design-to mass 75 kg, not-to-exceed mass 97.5 kg (30% margin)
**Set by:** humanoid-systems-architect
**Affects:** robotics-actuation-structures, robotics-sensing-autonomy, space-environments, humanoid-systems-architect (budget), conops-integrator
**Basis:** Tradespace of five candidates weighted against seven criteria; bipedal form scores highest (3.65/5.00) driven by human tool and environment compatibility (C1, weight 0.25) — the lunar far side base is built for humans, and maintaining dual tool and infrastructure standards for a non-human-geometry robot over a 20-year permanent base lifetime is more costly than the locomotion and mass penalties of the bipedal form. Centaur is the close second (3.55); it becomes the correct answer if the base infrastructure is designed for robots before crew arrival, which the current program timeline does not support. Four end-effectors (feet and hands) must support both bipedal surface locomotion and handrail-grasp zero-g mobility as first-class modes — this requirement flows directly from the FEDOR/Skybot F-850 negative lesson.
